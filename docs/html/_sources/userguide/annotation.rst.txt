Annotation with Viola
======================

SV breakpoints in VCF files can be annotated by Viola.

Currently, BED/BEDGRAPH and FASTA formats are acceptable for annotation.


Microhomology Prediction
----------------------------

Publicly available SV data often do not have information on microhomology. Some SV callers also do not output it.
